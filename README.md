# Woven React

Mostly Unfinished, as React/frontend development is not paricularly my strong suit.

##Things to Consider

While I was developing this, The intention was to create these forms to complete GET/REST requests to each of the endpoints running from the Springboot Backend, however this will fail due to a CORS error in 'preflight'
Honestly, I'm sure there's an easy way to fix this; some of my friends had mentioned to route requests via haproxy so that they'd have the same origin, but at least within a couple hours of messing around/testing, I could not get it to work fully.

That said, This will remain as a super basic boilerplate frontend that will serve as a monument of my desire to improve my frontend skills
